# Sentiment Analysis For Product Reviews

# Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. It aims to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing valuable insights for businesses and recommend the best Machine Learning model for the process.

# Project Description

The project employs NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal to preprocess the text data. Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are trained and evaluated for sentiment classification. The performance of each model is assessed based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

# Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- spaCy
